# üõí Zepto Sales Data Analysis using SQL

A hands-on SQL project analyzing a dataset inspired by Zepto's product catalog. The goal is to clean the data, analyze pricing, discounts, stock availability, and derive actionable insights using advanced SQL queries.

---
## üìå Project Overview

The goal is to simulate how real data analysts in e-commerce or retail industries use SQL to:

‚úÖ Create and populate a realistic inventory database  
‚úÖ Explore product categories, prices, and stock inconsistencies  
‚úÖ Clean data (fix nulls, remove invalids, normalize prices)  
‚úÖ Generate actionable insights with business-driven SQL queries

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Used
- SQL (DDL, DML, Aggregations, CASE, JOINS)
- Data Cleaning & Validation
- Pricing & Revenue Analysis
- Categorization & Conditional Logic
---
## üìÅ Dataset Description
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was originally scraped from Zepto‚Äôs official product listings. It mimics what you‚Äôd typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility ‚Äì exactly how real catalog data looks.

Columns:
- `category`: Product category
- `name`: Product name
- `mrp`: Maximum retail price
- `discountPercent`: Discount percentage
- `availableQuantity`: Units in stock
- `discountedSellingPrice`: Final price
- `weightInGms`: Product weight
- `outOfStock`: Boolean flag
- `quantity`: Units per order
---
## üìä Key Analysis
- Null and invalid value detection
- MRPs with value `0` cleanup
- Price normalization (`/100.0`)
- Top discounted and high-priced items
- Category-wise revenue calculation
- Price per gram calculation
- Weight classification: Low, Medium, Bulk
- Products with multiple price variants

## üß† Project Workflow

### 1. üóÉÔ∏è Table Creation
```sql
CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);
```

---

### 2. üì• Data Import
Use `pgAdmin` import or this command in PostgreSQL:

```sql
\copy zepto(category,name,mrp,discountPercent,availableQuantity,
discountedSellingPrice,weightInGms,outOfStock,quantity)
FROM 'data/zepto.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true);
```

---

### 3. üîç Data Exploration
- Count total records
- Check sample data
- Identify nulls or missing fields
- List all categories
- Compare stock vs out-of-stock items
- Find duplicate product names with different prices

---

### 4. üßπ Data Cleaning
- Removed rows where MRP or Discounted Price = 0
- Converted MRP and prices from paise to ‚Çπ
- Fixed inconsistent category column header
- Removed nulls and corrected data types

---

### 5. üìä Business Insights
- Top 10 highest discounted products
- High MRP items that are out of stock
- Potential revenue per category
- Expensive products with low discounts
- Average discounts by category (top 5)
- Best price per gram products
- Weight category classification (Low, Medium, Bulk)
- Total stock weight per category
- Products with multiple pricing SKUs
